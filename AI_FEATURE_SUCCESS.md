## 🔧 Technical Solution

### Problem Encountered:
- Initial API key validation errors
- Error: "API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key."

### Root Cause:
- New API keys from Google AI Studio use **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model
- Code was configured for older **Gemini Pro** model
- Model mismatch caused authentication failures

### Solution Implemented:
Changed model in `backend/src/services/aiService.js`:
```javascript
// Before (didn't work with new API keys)
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-pro' });

// After (works with new API keys from AI Studio)
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp' });
```

### Result:
✅ Immediate success after model change
✅ No code changes needed elsewhere
✅ All features working perfectly
