## 🎨 UI Design Plan

### Share Button Location:
1. **In Job Posting Form** - After creating/publishing
2. **In Job List View** - Share button on each job card
3. **In Job Details View** - Prominent share section

### Share Modal Design:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Share Job Posting                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  Senior Software Engineer           │
│  Engineering • Remote • $120k-160k  │
│                                     │
│  Share to:                          │
│                                     │
│  [LinkedIn] [Twitter] [Facebook]    │
│  [Email]    [WhatsApp] [Copy Link]  │
│                                     │
│  ✓ Job link copied!                 │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

```

---

## 🎯 Analytics Tracking

Track:
- Which platforms are most used
- Share success rate
- Click-through rate on shared links
- Most shared job positions

Store in database:
```javascript
{
  jobId: "...",
  platform: "linkedin",
  sharedBy: "userId",
  sharedAt: "timestamp",
  clicks: 0,
  applications: 0
}
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Public Job View:**
   - No authentication required
   - Only show published jobs
   - Hide internal notes/data
   - Rate limiting to prevent scraping

2. **Share Links:**
   - Use UUID for job IDs (not sequential)
   - Option to disable sharing per job
   - Expiration dates for links (optional)

3. **Analytics:**
   - Don't expose sensitive data
   - Aggregate analytics only
   - GDPR compliant
