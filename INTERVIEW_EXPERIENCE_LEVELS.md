  // Generate VERY SIMPLE questions
  // All 5 questions: EASY to MEDIUM
  difficultyGuidance = "Focus on BASIC concepts...";
  
} else if (experienceLevel.includes('mid') || experienceLevel.includes('intermediate')) {
  // Generate PRACTICAL questions
  // 2 Easy, 2 Medium, 1 Hard
  difficultyGuidance = "Test practical experience...";
  
} else if (experienceLevel.includes('senior') || experienceLevel.includes('lead')) {
  // Generate EXPERT questions
  // 1 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard
  difficultyGuidance = "Test deep expertise...";
}
