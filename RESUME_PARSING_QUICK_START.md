## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Resume uploaded. Auto-fill unavailable"
**Cause:** AI parsing failed or network error
**Solution:** No problem! User can fill form manually. Feature has graceful fallback.

### Issue: No fields auto-filled
**Check:**
1. Is backend running?
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Is GEMINI_API_KEY set in backend/.env?
4. Try a different resume file

### Issue: "Failed to parse resume"
**Possible Causes:**
- Scanned/image-based PDF (no text to extract)
- Corrupted file
- Very small file with no content

**Solution:** Try a text-based PDF or DOCX file

### Issue: Backend port already in use
**Error:** `EADDRINUSE: address already in use`
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
# Or use different port
PORT=5001 npm start
```
